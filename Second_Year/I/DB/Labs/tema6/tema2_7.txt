Enter and run the following PL/SQL block. It will execute correctly if you have entered it correctly,

explicit data type conversions, meaningful and consistent variable names, use of %TYPE,

DECLARE
 myvar1 VARCHAR2(20);
 myvar2 number(4);
BEGIN
SELECT country_name INTO myvar1
FROM countries WHERE country_id = 421;
 myvar2 :=
 '1234';
 MYVAR2 := myvar2 * 2;
 DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(myvar1);
 End;
 
 DECLARE
    v_country_name VARCHAR2(20);
    v_country_id number(4) := 421;
    v_number number(4);
BEGIN
    SELECT country_name 
    INTO v_country_name
    FROM countries 
    WHERE country_id = v_country_id;

    v_number :='1234';

    v_number := v_number * 2;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_country_name);
End;
