Database Programming with PL/SQL
4-1: Conditional Control: IF Statements

Vocabulary

Statement that enables PL/SQL to perform actions selectively
based on conditions. - if statement

Control structures – Repetition statements that enable you to
execute statements in a PL/SQL block repeatedly. - loop

An expression with a TRUE or FALSE value that is used to
make a decision. - boolean 

An expression that determines a course of action based on
conditions and can be used outside a PL/SQL block in a SQL
statement. - case

1. What is the purpose of a conditional control structure in PL/SQL?
Answer: A conditional control structure allows PL/SQL to execute specific code blocks based on whether certain conditions are met.

2. List the three categories of control structures in PL/SQL.
Conditional control (e.g., IF, CASE)
Iterative control (e.g., LOOP, WHILE, FOR)
Sequential control (e.g., GOTO)

3. List the keywords that can be part of an IF statement.
IF
THEN
ELSIF
ELSE
END IF

4. List the keywords that are a required part of an IF statement.
IF
THEN
END IF

5. Write a PL/SQL block to find the population of a given country in the countries table. Display a
message indicating whether the population is greater than or less than 1 billion (1,000,000,000).

Test your block twice using India (country_id = 91) and United Kingdom (country_id = 44). India’s
population should be greater than 1 billion, while United Kingdom’s should be less than 1 billion.

DECLARE
  v_population NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT population INTO v_population
  FROM countries
  WHERE country_id = 91; 
  
  IF v_population > 1000000000 THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Population is greater than 1 billion.');
  ELSE
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Population is less than 1 billion.');
  END IF;
END;

6. Modify the code from the previous exercise so that it handles all the following cases:
A. Population is greater than 1 billion.
B. Population is greater than 0.
C. Population is 0.
D. Population is null. (Display: No data for this country.)
Run your code using the following country ids. Confirm the indicated results.
• China (country_id = 86): Population is greater than 1 billion.
• United Kingdom (country_id = 44): Population is greater than 0.
• Antarctica (country_id = 672): Population is 0.
• Europa Island (country_id = 15): No data for this country.

DECLARE
  v_population NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT population INTO v_population
  FROM countries
  WHERE country_id = :country_id;  
  
  IF v_population > 1000000000 THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Population is greater than 1 billion.');
  ELSIF v_population > 0 THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Population is greater than 0.');
  ELSIF v_population = 0 THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Population is 0.');
  ELSE
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No data for this country.');
  END IF;
END;


7. Examine the following code:
DECLARE
 v_country_id countries.country_name%TYPE := <a value>;
 v_ind_date countries.date_of_independence%TYPE;
 v_natl_holiday countries.national_holiday_date%TYPE;
BEGIN
 SELECT date_of_independence, national_holiday_date
 INTO v_ind_date, v_natl_holiday
 FROM countries
 WHERE country_id = v_country_id;
 IF v_ind_date IS NOT NULL THEN
 DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('A');
 ELSIF v_natl_holiday IS NOT NULL THEN
 DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('B');
 ELSIF v_natl_holiday IS NULL AND v_ind_date IS NULL THEN
 DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('C');
 END IF;
END;

A. What would print if the country has an independence date equaling NULL and a national
holiday date equaling NULL?
If both v_ind_date and v_natl_holiday are NULL, the code will print C.

B. What would print if the country has an independence date equaling NULL and a national
holiday date containing a value?
If v_ind_date is NULL and v_natl_holiday has a value, the code will print B.

C. What would print if the country has an independence date equaling a value and a national
holiday date equaling NULL?
If v_ind_date has a value and v_natl_holiday is NULL, the code will print A.

D. Run a SELECT statement against the COUNTRIES table to determine whether the following
countries have independence dates or national holiday dates, or both. Predict the output of
running the anonymous block found at the beginning of this question.

Predicted Outputs:
Antarctica (672): Both dates are likely NULL, so output should be C.
Iraq (964): Iraq likely has an independence date but no national holiday, so output should be A.
Spain (34): Spain might have both dates, so output should be A (since IF only checks independence date).
United States (1): Likely has both dates; output should be A.

E. Finally, run the anonymous block found at the beginning of this question using each of the
above country ids as input. Check whether your output answers are correct.

8. Examine the following code. What output do you think it will produce?
DECLARE
 v_num1 NUMBER(3) := 123;
 v_num2 NUMBER;
BEGIN
 IF v_num1 <> v_num2 THEN
 DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The two numbers are not equal');
 ELSE
 DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The two numbers are equal');
 END IF;
END;

Run the code to check if your prediction was correct. What was the result and why? Modify the
code to use various comparison operators to see different results.

IF v_num2 IS NULL THEN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('v_num2 is NULL');
END IF;

9. Write a PL/SQL block to accept a year and check whether it is a leap year. For example, if the
year entered is 1990, the output should be “1990 is not a leap year.”

DECLARE
  v_year NUMBER := 2024;  
BEGIN
  IF (v_year MOD 400 = 0) OR (v_year MOD 4 = 0 AND v_year MOD 100 <> 0) THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_year || ' is a leap year');
  ELSE
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_year || ' is not a leap year');
  END IF;
END;

Hint: A leap year should be exactly divisible by 4, but not exactly divisible by 100. However, any
year exactly divisible by 400 is a leap year.
