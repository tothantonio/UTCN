9-6: Using Invokerâ€™s Rights
Vocabulary

Routines are bound to the schema in which they reside: Definer's Rights
Routines let you centralize data retrieval whereas multiple users can manage their own data using a single code base: Invoker's Rights
Subprograms that allow your session to have two or more active transactions at the same time: Autonomous Transactions

1.Describe both procedures:

DESCRIBE IACAD_SCHEMA.show_emps_def;
DESCRIBE IACAD_SCHEMA.show_emps_inv;

2.SQL to select directly from the table:

SELECT * FROM IACAD_SCHEMA.EMPS WHERE employee_id = 100;

3.Differences between definer's rights and invoker's rights:

Definer's Rights: Executes with the privileges of the schema where the procedure resides.
Invoker's Rights: Executes with the privileges of the user invoking the procedure, allowing centralized logic while respecting user-specific access

4.Execute show_emps_def with employee_id = 100:

EXEC IACAD_SCHEMA.show_emps_def(100);

Explanation: The procedure will succeed if your schema can access IACAD_SCHEMA.EMPS. Since definer's rights are used, it uses the privileges of IACAD_SCHEMA.

5.Execute show_emps_def with employee_id = 10:

EXEC IACAD_SCHEMA.show_emps_def(10);

Explanation: Since no employee with ID 10 exists, the NO_DATA_FOUND exception will be raised, and the procedure will print a message indicating no data found.

6.Execute show_emps_inv with employee_id = 100:

EXEC IACAD_SCHEMA.show_emps_inv(100);

Explanation: This procedure runs under invoker's rights, so it will only work if your schema has direct access to IACAD_SCHEMA.EMPS.

7.Changes needed for show_emps_inv to work:

Grant the required SELECT privilege on EMPS to your schema.
Ensure proper parameter data types and handling are in place.
