1.create table time_ex3 (first_column timestamp with time zone,
second_column timestamp with local time zone);
insert into time_ex3
(first_column,
 second_column)
values
(to_timestamp_tz('2016-11-0116:02:08.236+05:30','yyyy-mm-ddhh24:mi:ss.fftzh:tzm'),
to_timestamp_tz('2016-11-0116:02:08.236+05:30','yyyy-mm-ddhh24:mi:ss.fftzh:tzm'));

create table time_ex4
(loan_duration1 interval year(3) to month,
loan_duration2  interval year(2) to month);
insert into time_ex4 (loan_duration1, loan_duration2 )
values( interval '120' month(3), interval '3-6' year to month);

create table time_ex5
(day_duration1 interval day(3) to second,
day_duration2  interval day(3) to second);
insert into time_ex5 (day_duration1, day_duration2 )
values( interval '25' day(2), interval '4 10:30:10' day to second);

2.alter session set time_zone = '-05:00';
select * from time_ex3;

select to_char( sysdate + loan_duration1 , 'dd-month-yyyy') as "120 months from now", to_char( sysdate + loan_duration2 , 'dd-month-yyyy') as "3 years 6 months from now"
from time_ex4;

select
to_char( sysdate , 'dd-month-yyyy hh:mi:ss') as now,
 to_char( sysdate + day_duration1 , 'dd-month-yyyy hh:mi:ss') as "25 days from now",
 to_char( sysdate + day_duration2 , 'dd-month-yyyy hh:mi:ss') as "4day10hr30min10sec from now "
from time_ex5;

3. when your data is international and must be correct for every specific time zone
