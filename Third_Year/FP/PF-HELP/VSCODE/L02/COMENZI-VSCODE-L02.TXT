Hello! Elm projects always start with an elm.json file. I can create them!
Now you may be wondering, what will be in this file? How do I add Elm files to
my project? How do I see it in the browser? How will my code grow? Do I need
more directories? What about tests? Etc.
Check out <https://elm-lang.org/0.19.1/init> for all the answers!
Knowing all that, would you like me to create an elm.json file now? [Y/n]: Y

-- NO OFFLINE SOLUTION ---------------------------------------------------------

I tried to create an elm.json with the following direct dependencies:

    elm/browser
    elm/core
    elm/html

I could not find compatible versions though, but that may be because I could not
connect to https://package.elm-lang.org to get the latest list of packages. Are
you able to connect to the internet? Please ask around one of the community
forums at https://elm-lang.org/community for help!

Okay, I created it. Now read that link!

Terminal:
echo $PATH

This prints /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin on my computer. 
-When run"
elm make src/Main.elm
terminal starts by searching these five directories for an executable file named elm. It finds /usr/local/bin/elm and then runs /usr/local/bin/elm make src/Main.elm with whatever arguments I gave.
